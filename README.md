## 🧑‍💻 By the creator </br>
Well I know it's a basic project, still I consider it as one of my coolest ones. </br>
I've done a bit of animation in it using python for the very first time and of course I did take a bit of help from chatgpt because I had some issues implementing it on my mac. :) </br>
